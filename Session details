Hi everyone, thank you for watching my session.

The AWS Sample Solution and test data is available here:
https://github.com/aws/amazon-sagemaker-examples/blob/main/end_to_end/fraud_detection/0-AutoClaimFraudDetection.ipynb

Customize the solution with your data
Play with the clarify to create different bias and explainability metrics.

Pre-processing can be done using local python code or using spark glue. Wrangler is expensive.
Then bypass the wrangler flow module and use pre-processed dataset directly in Module -1.
